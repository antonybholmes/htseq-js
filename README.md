# htseq-js

A library for reading BAM files for sequence alignments. I could not find a decent implementation of a reader so I decided to write one from scratch
in TypeScript as a way to understand the BAM file specification and create a clean, documented implementation which might serve as a learning reference
for other projects.

This is an early alpha version so check for updates as I fix things.
